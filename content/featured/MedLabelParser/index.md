MedLabel Parser extracts medicine names, compositions, and expiry dates from labels. It uses AWS S3 for image storage, MongoDB for scalable database management, and JWT-based SSO for secure authentication. The system is designed for 100% scalability and efficiency with service splitting, redundancy, partitioning, caching, queues, and sharding. CI/CD pipelines, containers, and Kubernetes are used for seamless deployments.
